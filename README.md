# How to clone this repository
1. Start by creating directory on your local machine where all your github projects should be placed. In this example we will call the directory for github projects.
2. Navigate to the previously created directory using either the bash command cd or by locating it and opening a terminal in your current directory (Type cmd in address bar on windows / right click in your folder and select 'Open in Terminal' on OS x/linux).
3. Now it is time to clone the repository, you do this by finding the https clone link on github.
```git
git clone https://github.com/lass7965/test.git
```
4. A folder has now been created in your current directory which contains the files from the cloned repository. To view the contents of your current directory you can do 'ls' on linux/OS x and 'dir' on windows.
